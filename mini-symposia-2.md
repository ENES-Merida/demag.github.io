**Abstract:**

*Computational modelling of physiological processes is essential for advancing our understanding of biomedical systems, requiring the integration of multi-scale and multi-physics approaches to capture the complexity of both organ-level and microscopic dynamics.*

*Fluid dynamics within the human body presents significant challenges due to the intricate interplay between various physical and biological processes, including pulsatile blood flow in the cardiovascular system, airflow and particle transport in the respiratory tract, and organisms interactions in complex fluids such as mucus, among others. Addressing these challenges requires sophisticated computational fluid dynamics (CFD), fluid-structure interaction (FSI), and other coupled transport models to capture phenomena involving tissue mechanics, fluid dynamics, energy transport, and microbial hydrodynamics.*

*High-performance computing (HPC) plays a pivotal role in enabling large-scale, highfidelity simulations necessary for capturing these complex interactions with high resolution and efficiency. Additionally, in the era of AI, integrating advanced machine learning (ML) and data-driven modelling techniques is essential. These methods not only enhance the efficiency of processing large-scale simulation data, but also enable the development of surrogate models that reduce computational costs. Moreover, they pave the way for personalised, patient-specific simulations and the creation of digital twins, thereby advancing precision medicine.*

*This mini-symposium will bring together recent advancements in computational modelling and simulation techniques for HPC-driven biomedical simulations, covering topics such as physiological flow modelling in the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, organism transport in complex biological fluids, ML-enhanced surrogate modelling, and scalable algorithms for multi-physics simulations. By fostering interdisciplinary discussions, we aim to bridge the fields of computational biomechanics, fluid dynamics, and HPC to advance the next generation of biomedical simulations.*
