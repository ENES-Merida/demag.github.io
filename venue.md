The conference will take place at the ["Centro Cultural Universitario"](https://www.cultura.uady.mx/ccu.html) (CCU), located in the downtown area of [Mérida City](https://visitmerida.mx/). CCU  is the main hub of activities at the Autonomous University of Yucatán. It is located in the historic building that housed the University since its beginnings.
