**Abstract:**

*AI technologies are now used in almost every area of research and industry. They automate and accelerate processes, and uncover new, unseen relations in huge datasets. Such technologies are used to develop new models for CFD, e.g., reduced-order models, surrogates, and closure models aiming at efficiently modeling complex physics that are otherwise expensive to compute. Furthermore, reinforcement learning algorithms are used for flow control applications, while receiving feedback from CFD solvers after an action. The quality of these methods is often a function of both the quantity and the accuracy of the underlying data used for training, as well as the physical constraints imposed. HPC systems are required to create and process high-fidelity simulation data, with an increasing number of CFD solvers running on both CPU and GPU partitions. Modular and heterogeneous systems with accelerator and/or specialized AI components as blueprints for future HPC systems have the potential to deal with the demands of complex and intertwined simulations and AI data processing workflows towards foundation and multi-modal models and their application for CFD. This mini-symposium aims at continuing the successful 2022 – 2024 AI+HPC4CFD mini-symposia. It gathers experts in the fields of development and application of parallel CFD methods incorporating novel AI methods, and pure AI method developers contributing to the fields of CFD and HPC alike. It offers a platform for discussion and exchange in the context of the convergence of AI and HPC with respect to parallel CFD methods using the power of future computing systems.*

*Topics of interest for this mini-symposium include, but are not limited to:*
1. *Physics-informed/-aware architectures for, e.g., efficient flow field predictions.*
2. *AI technologies for accelerating CFD workflows on HPC machines.*
3. *Coupling AI training and/or inference to CFD simulations.*
4. *Optimization and flow control using, e.g., reinforcement learning techniques.*
5. *Foundational and multi-modal models for CFD.*
6. *Super-resolution, AI-based turbulence, surrogate modeling.*
7. *Benchmarking neural network architectures for CFD applications.*
8. *General neural network architectures to predict flow quantities (also temporally) for a wide set of applications, e.g., in combustion, aerodynamics, bio-fluid mechanics, or further engineering applications.*
