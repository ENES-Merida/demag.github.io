## Lennart Schneiders - SIEMENS Digital Industries Software

Lennart Schneiders is a Software Engineer and researcher at Siemens Digital Industries Software. He received his PhD from RWTH Aachen University in 2017. Until 2022, he was a postdoctoral researcher at RWTH Aachen, JÃ¼lich Aachen Research Alliance, and California Institute of Technology. Lennart is currently a developer of the multiphysics CFD software Simcenter STAR-CCM+. His research interests lie in numerical method development, turbulent multiphase flow, and high-performance computing.

**Title of Lennart&#x27;s keynote lecture:** *The intricacies of adaptive unstructured mesh refinement for industrial flows.*

**Abstract:**

*The simulation of industrial flows is associated with significant uncertainties arising from the quality of the computational mesh. In many industries, meshing therefore is considered an expert job. With the advances in parallel computing and GPU hardware reducing solver times, meshing can become a bottleneck in certain industrial workflows. While adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is an intriguing approach to alleviate some of those problems, developing such a technique in a robust form is a challenge in its own.*

*In this talk, the intricacies of developing a general purpose AMR scheme are discussed. This includes the definition of generic solution-based refinement strategies. And it will be demonstrated that refining an unstructured mesh does not automatically guarantee lower truncation errors, but can even lead to the opposite.*

## Christian Hasse - Technical University Darmstadt, Simulation of reactive Thermo-Fluid Systems

Christian Hasse is full professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Darmstadt University of Technology. He holds the chair of Simulation of reactive Thermo-Fluid Systems. He has supervised successfully more than 30 PhD students and currently 25 PhD students and post-docs are working in his group. He has more than 270 peer-reviewed publications and has served in multiple editorial boards and as associate/guest editor. He is organizer of scientific workshops and conferences focusing on sustainable combustion to achieve net zero emissions.

Prof. Hasse is elected Fellow of the Combustion Institute for his contributions on turbulent combustion, solid fuel combustion, multi-phase flow and soot formation. He has been elected to the Board of Directors of the International Combustion Institute in 2024. His main research interests are modeling and high-fidelity simulation of reactive and non-reactive flows, especially for CO2-free and CO2-neutral fuels such as hydrogen, ammonia, biomass, E-fuels and metals. In addition to fundamental studies on flame structures and dynamics, he also actively works on transferring these results to real-world applications including (aero-)engines, boilers and processes chemical engineering. For these topics, his group has developed a number of high-fidelity software applications that are deployed national Tier-2 and European Tier-0/1 supercomputers. In 2024 he has received an ERC Advanced Grant on aluminum steam combustion in which he aims to unravel the fundamental properties of pressurized Al-steam flames for the entire scientific chain, from single particles to turbulent flames with millions of particles, through a well-orchestrated combination of high-fidelity simulations, advanced modeling, and tailored experiments.

**Title of Christian&#x27;s keynote lecture:** *How high-fidelity simulations of hydrogen combustion on supercomputers accelerate the energy transition.*

**Abstract:**

*Reactive Computational Fluid Dynamics (rCFD) has become an indispensable tool in fundamental and applied research. In addition, rCFD is used in industrial design, such as aero engine combustors or gas turbines. This success is based on the combination of decades of scientific model development, efficient numerics and ever-increasing computing power. This situation is about to change as both the energy system (1) and the HPC architecture (2) are undergoing disruptive changes.*

*First, the urgent need to shift from fossil fuels to renewable fuels such as hydrogen requires the redesign of energy conversion systems due to the completely different combustion characteristics of renewable fuels. Combustion models for high-fidelity simulations are lacking and must be developed based on in-depth physical understanding. Second, the next generation of supercomputers will be mostly based on GPUs rather than CPUs. Efficient use of these systems will require a new class of CFD software with specialized numerics.*

*In this talk I will first introduce the role of rCFD in combustion system design before I highlight the role of hydrogen in the energy transition and how it differs from conventional fuels. After discussing the impact of GPU-based supercomputers on rCFD software development, I will present how GPU-based direct numerical simulations can unravel the complexities of hydrogen combustion.*

*In summary, in a rapidly changing environment, simulations on upcoming Exascale systems will provide physical insights that were deemed impossible just a few years ago. This will increase the impact of rCFD on the entire spectrum from fundamental science to industrial design of innovative systems.*
